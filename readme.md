Rust Map Generator
==================

Generates maps procedurally and displays them in terminal.  Has support for
rivers, biomes, temperature and precipitation maps.  To modify some of the
params directly edit the config struct in `src/main.rs` for now, later this
will become a json or toml file you can just edit.


Build
-----

As usual, just build and run with:

```sh
$ cargo run --release
```
